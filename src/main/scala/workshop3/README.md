#Workshop 3

In this workshop we cover Collections, Option, Try and higher-order functions on these classes.
Please read through the material in the following order, before proceeding to the assignments.

* [higher-order functions](higher-order-functions.md) - *getting to know what a higher-order function is, how it looks and how you use it*
* [some basic higher-order functions in Scala](functional-operators.md)
* [`Option`](option.md) - *introducing the `Option` type as an alternative to `null` values*
* [`flatMap` and for-comprehension on `Option`](option-flatmap.md)
* [for-comprehension on `List`](list-for-comprehensions.md)
* [`Try`](try.md) - *introducting the `Try` type as **the** way of handling errors in a functional way*
* [other collections](other-collections.md) - *conversion between Java and Scala collections and some more operators*
