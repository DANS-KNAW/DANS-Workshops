Rx ecosystem
============

Besides the language implementations such as RxJava, RxScala, Rx.NET, RxJS, RxGroovy, RxRuby, etc. etc. there are lots of other projects that apply the Rx principles to various other domains, such as Strings, arithmatic, file systems, databases and JavaFx.

Have a look at the [ReactiveX] GitHub organisation, as well as repositories by [DavidMoten], and have a look at some of the projects. Prepare some notes or small demos for some of the projects you like and let's discuss them during the workshop. Also feel free to do a pull request with your code examples.

Here is a list of some of the projects you may want to take a look at (in no particular order):

* [RxJavaString](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaString)
* [RxJavaFx](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX)
* [RxApacheHttp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxApacheHttp)
* [RxJavaMath](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaMath)
* [RxJavaFileUtils](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFileUtils)
* [RxJava-file](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-file)
* [RxJava-extras](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-extras)
